# GherkinLang
Simple plugin to support Gherkin. You can use it as a template to create plugins.

### Installation
Installation is pretty straight forward: clone the repo in StudIO, open it and close it (so StudIO can read the `studio-package.json` file).
Then, simply tap on the + inside a box button in the navbar. Select and add the plugin, and you should be good to go.
